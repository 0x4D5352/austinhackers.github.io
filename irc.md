While traditionally the best way to communicate in AHA was the [mailing
list]({{ site.mailinglistpage }}), now the most common place to find us
is on IRC and discord. We can be found on the [Libera](http://libera.chat/) IRC
Network in the channel #AHA.

* Server: irc.libera.chat
* Channel: #AHA
* There is now a key needed to access the channel. Please show up to a meeting to get it.

There are no specific channel rules, but please do not ask stupid
questions like, "How do I hack X" or showing up to simply cause drama.
This is a good place to talk to speakers from past meetings about their
projects, or to look for feedback on your own talk.
