  <h1> About Us</h1>
    The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
    security professionals in the Austin, Texas area.
  <p>
    We have monthly [meetings!][Meetings] We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, and play poker.
  <p>
    Our meetings usually last anywhere from two to three hours, are in a
    public location like a restaurant, library, or other public meeting
    space, and consist of short "turbo-talks" from anyone that would like
    to speak on a topic for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. There is
    usually a projector and screen if you wish to use a slide deck or
    perform demos. If you wish to give a talk longer than 10 minutes,
    please notify someone on the mailing list or before the meeting and
    expect to talk last. As well, if you wish to give a talk about
    recruitment for your company, come prepared to buy drinks/alcohol for
    everyone in attendance.
  <p>
    Participation is mandatory for continued membership in the group. What
    this means, is that to retain a subscription to the mailing list, and
    to not get heckled at the meetings, you must contribute to the group
    in some form. Potential ways to contribute currently include:
            <li>Attending the meetings and <b>speaking</b> about what you're working on, what you're up to, etc.</li>
            <li>Participation in discussions on the mailing list.</li>
    <p>
        <i>Note, it is up to The Mob™ to decide whether or not you are
    participating enough, and if it seems that you aren't the heavy-hand
    of the AHA Lords will come down upon you and you will be un-subbed from the
    email list, booted from IRC and/or heckled regularly if you continue to show up to the
    meetings.</i>
  <p>
    If you are from out of town, showing up to a meeting when you happen
    to be in town and then continuing to participate in discussions on the
    email list may be considered sufficient. If you are <b>NOT</b> from out of
    town, you will be held to a higher standard… likely being expected to
    speak at the meetings at least every other meeting that you attend or
    so.
  <p>
    Simply showing up to the meetings and hiding in the shadows or lurking
    on the email list is definitely <b>NOT</b> a sufficient level of
    participation.
