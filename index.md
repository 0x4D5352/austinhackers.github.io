# AHA! is Austinite Hackers of Austin!

The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
security professionals in the Austin, Texas area.

We have monthly [meetings!]({{ site.meetingpage }}) We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, and play poker.

Please see the [About Us]({{ site.aboutuspage }}) page for more information on our
[meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }}) and expectations.

## How to Join Austin Hackers Academy

There are a couple ways you can get involved:

* Read the About AHA! page, where you can learn all about Austin Hackers Anonymous!
* Come to the [meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }})
* Get on one of the AHA! [mailing lists]({{ site.mailinglistpage }})

*NOTE: By "Academy" we mean we don't actually teach you anything. We are
not a school.[1]*

*[1] NOTE ADDENDUM: The preceding note does not mean we are not affiliated
with the University of China in Austin, Texas. That is still a topic of
debate.*
