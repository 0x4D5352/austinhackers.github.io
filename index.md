The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
security professionals in the Austin, Texas area.

We have monthly [meetings!][Meetings] We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, and play poker.

Our meetings usually last anywhere from two to three hours, are in a
public location like a restaurant, library, or other public meeting
space, and consist of short "turbo-talks" from anyone that would like
to speak on a topic for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. There is
usually a projector and screen if you wish to use a slide deck or
perform demos. If you wish to give a talk longer than 10 minutes,
please notify someone on the mailing list or before the meeting and
expect to talk last. As well, if you wish to give a talk about
recruitment for your company, come prepared to buy drinks/alcohol for
everyone in attendance.

Participation is mandatory for continued membership in the group. What
this means, is that to retain a subscription to the mailing list, and
to not get heckled at the meetings, you must contribute to the group
in some form. Potential ways to contribute currently include:

* Attending the meetings and **speaking** about what you're working on, what you're up to, etc.
* Participation in discussions on the mailing list.

*Note, it is up to The Mob™ to decide whether or not you are
participating enough, and if it seems that you aren't the heavy-hand
of the AHA Lords will come down upon you and you will be un-subbed from the
email list, booted from IRC and/or heckled regularly if you continue to show up to the
meetings.*

If you are from out of town, showing up to a meeting when you happen
to be in town and then continuing to participate in discussions on the
email list may be considered sufficient. If you are **NOT** from out of
town, you will be held to a higher standard… likely being expected to
speak at the meetings at least every other meeting that you attend or
so.

Simply showing up to the meetings and hiding in the shadows or lurking
on the email list is definitely **NOT** a sufficient level of
participation.
