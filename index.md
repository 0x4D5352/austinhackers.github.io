# AHA! is Austinite Hackers of Austin!

The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
security professionals in the Austin, Texas area. We have monthly [meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }}) that offer short 5-10 minute presentations about a large range of topics including computer security, physical security, pentesting, electronics, programming, and general nerd/geekery.

Please see the [About Us]({{ site.aboutuspage }}) page for more information on our
[meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }}) and expectations.

## How to Join Austin Hackers Academy

There is no formal membership for AHA! There are however a couple ways you can get involved:

* Read the [About AHA!]({{ site.aboutuspage }}) page, where you can learn all about Austin Hackers Anonymous!
* Come to the [meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }})
* Get on one of the AHA! [mailing lists]({{ site.mailinglistpage }})
* Join us on IRC (*freenode/#AHA*)

*NOTE: By "Academy" we mean we don't actually teach you anything. We are
not a school.[1]*

*[1] NOTE ADDENDUM: The preceding note does not mean we are not affiliated
with the University of China in Austin, Texas. That is still a topic of
debate.*
