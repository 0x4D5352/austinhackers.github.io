### Who we are
The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
security professionals in the Austin, Texas area.

We have monthly [meetings!]({{ site.meetingpage }}) We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, and drink beer together.

### Our Meetings
Our meetings usually last anywhere from two to three hours, are in a
public location like a restaurant, library, or other public meeting
space, and consist of short "turbo-talks" from anyone that would like
to speak on a topic for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. There is
usually a projector and screen if you wish to use a slide deck or
perform demos. If you wish to give a talk longer than 10 minutes,
please notify someone on the mailing list or before the meeting and
expect to talk last. As well, if you wish to give a talk about
recruitment for your company, come prepared to buy drinks/alcohol for
everyone in attendance.

### Participation
Participation is mandatory for continued membership in the group. What
this means, is that to retain a subscription to the mailing list, and
to not get heckled at the meetings, you must contribute to the group
in some form. Potential ways to contribute currently include:

* Attending the meetings and **speaking** about what you're working on, what you're up to, etc.
* Participation in discussions on the mailing list or IRC.

> **Note**, *it is up to The Mob. to decide whether or not you are
participating enough, and if it seems that you aren't the heavy-hand of
the AHA Lords will come down upon you and you will be un-subbed from the
email list, booted from IRC and/or heckled regularly if you continue to
show up to the meetings.*

### Presentation Ideas
The scariest thing for most people is trying to figure out what to
present on at AHA! While this may seem challenging, it's actually quite
easy. We have some basic suggestions that may help you:

* Present your own material/work
 * We love code, demo's and live examples of work. But make it your own.
   Don't give us a 101 on a topic that any of us could just lookup
ourselves or read an already written how-to on.
* It doesn't have to be finished
 * If you've shown you're doing your own research but are stuck, come
   talk to us and we'll likely be able to help!
* No book reports
 * Don't tell us all about someone elses research that you read and now
   are regurgitating to us. Expand on it! Add to it!

Here's some topics of previous discussions at AHA!:

* Horror stories from Pentesting
* How to bypass physical security with a pop can
* Breaking down A/V detection one fingerprint at a time
* Reverse Engineering Blackhole Malware
* Building your own stun glove
* How to build your own AK47

Lastly, many of the best AHA! presentations were written one hour before
the meeting, or onsite during other speakers. We don't need overly
complicated powerpoint slides. In fact, some of the best talks were
simply screenshots and MS Paint with giant spray paint arrows. Make us laugh,
we'll love you for ever!

### Out of Town
If you are from out of town, showing up to a meeting when you happen
to be in town and then continuing to participate in discussions on the
email list/IRC *may* (but not always) be considered sufficient. If you are
**NOT** from out of town, you will be held to a higher standard... likely being
expected to speak at the meetings at least every other meeting that you attend
or so.

Simply showing up to the meetings and hiding in the shadows or lurking
on the email list is definitely **NOT** a sufficient level of
participation.
