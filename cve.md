Anonymous Hacking Alliance is pursuing an effort to become a **research oriented** [CVE Numbering Authority], under the [MITRE] program root.

To that end, AHA! will be adopting a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) for issues that we become aware of during [meetings](meetings.html). We'll also be maintaining a collection of artisanal, bespoke CVE entries (CVEs) that we publish.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Coming soon! Preamble goes here

### VDP

A short, easy to read and understand VDP goes here that covers things like coordinating with vendors, expected times for a fix prior to publishing, and generating and populating a CVE ID. Many examples abound, and we should probably just use a [disclose.io] boilerplate.

### Generating AHA! CVEs

* Present your findings at a regularly scheduled meeting, under the usual public embargo terms (see our [rules](rules.html) for more details).
  - The most important rule is, "What happens at AHA! stays at AHA!"
* Ask a CVE point of contact for a CVE ID reservation.
  - Note that reserving a CVE ID in no way breaks the usual AHA! embargo on material presented at AHA!
* Agree to abide by the the above VDP terms and conditions for publishing.
  - Failing to adehere to the VDP may result in expulsion from AHA!

### Contact
