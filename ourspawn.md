There have been a number of sibling groups that have spawned from AHA!,
generally emulating the turbo-talk style meeting format and attempting
to conform to an exclamation acronym of some form:

* [BAHA!][BAHA] Bay Area Hackers Association
* [CSHA][CSHA] - Colorado Springs Hackers Anonymous
* DOH! - Dallas Order of Hackers
* HAHA! - Houston Area Hackers Anonymous
* [NoVAH!][NoVAH] - Northern Virginia Hackers
* [PSSH!][PSSH] - Phoenix Secret Society of Hackers
* [SAHA!][SAHA] - San Antonio Hackers Association

Please note that we do not have direct affiliation to these groups and
they may operate under their own rules and policies. Please review their
websites for additional information.
