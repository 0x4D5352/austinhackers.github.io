This repo contains the new website for the AHA group. This is replacing the
old (and nasty) website that was previously hosted at wikidot.

In the near future If you wish to add your presentation, slides, notes or any
other materials from your talk at AHA, you'll be able to create a pull request.  

Keep watching this project for updates and documentation on this process.
