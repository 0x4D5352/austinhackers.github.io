There is currently only one AHA! e-mail list, called "aha", which is
used for general discussion. The mailing list is open to anyone who
lives in Austin, Texas or is willing to travel to Austin to attend the
[meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }}) and follow our [rules]({{ site.aboutuspage }}). **Subscription requests are moderated** and subject to a screening process â€” if we don't know who you
are, you will be asked to give a quick introduction and verify that you
plan on attending the meetings.
